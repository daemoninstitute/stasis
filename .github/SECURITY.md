# # Security Policy

The `stasis` project takes all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for your efforts to improve its security. Your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly are greatly appreciated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

`stasis` uses GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature to manage and resolve security issues. This ensures that your findings are received by the maintainer directly and are not publicly disclosed until a patch is available.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Security tab of the `stasis` repository](https://github.com/daemoninstitute/stasis/security).
2. Click on the "Report a vulnerability" button.
3. Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including:
   * A clear description of the vulnerability.
   * Steps to reproduce the issue.
   * The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   * Any suggested mitigations or patches, if available.

## Scope

This policy applies to the `stasis` project and its core source code. Please report vulnerabilities only in the code maintained within this repository.

The project maintainer is committed to working with you to understand and resolve the issue in a timely manner.
